## Summary:
We are in the process of creating an Ecommerce website. Users will be able to register and login with a username and password. When a user is registered an access_token is generated and is used to authenticate+authorize the user to login. 

At the moment we are using a HomeController with mock data to test that our front-end is able to pull some easy information.
